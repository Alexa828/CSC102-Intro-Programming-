        // let's create our first Variable - a variable is a piece of information that the program stores
        // camelCase
        // var is less concerned with scope 
        var firstName = "Alexa"; // this is a string variable 
        
        // snake_case
        // let is very concerned with scopw
        let first_name = "Alexa"; // this is a string variable

        // Javascript is a dynamically-type language 
        // Javascript tries to guess what the data type is your variable 
        let age = 25; // Javascript will assumethis is an integer (int) - a whole number

        let pi = 3.14; // Javascript will assume this is a float (decimal ponit)

        let validInput = false; // Javascript will assume this is a boolean - true/false 

        let last_name = ""; // We will set up the variable now, and get the value later

        // This is a valid way to set up a variable in Javascript 
        // In Javascript, please do not set up your variables without let or var

        // == is equality / are the values on the both sides the same/
        // = is assignment - thew value on the left side of the = will become the value on the right side 
        // === is where Javascript will compare both the value and the data type
