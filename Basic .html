        // let's create our first veriale - a variable is a piece of information that the program stores
        // camelCase
        //  var is less concerned with scope
        var firstName = "Alexa";  //this is a string varibale

        // snake_case
        //  let is ver concerned with scope
        let first_name = "Alexa"; // this is a string variable 

        // JavaScript is a dynamically-type language
        // JavaScript tries to guess what is the data type of variables 
        let age = 25; // JavaScript will assume this is an integer (int) - a whole number 

        let pi= 3.14; // JavaScript will assume this is a float (decimal poionts)

        let validInput = false; // JavaScript will assume that this is a boolean - true/false

        let Last_name; "" // we will set up the varibale now, and get the value later 

        // this is a valid way to set up a varibale in JavaScript 
        // in JavaScript please do not set up your varibales without let or var
